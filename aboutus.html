        <div class="content">
   Watoto Kumi Children's Home was founded in the year 2000 and started out as a mission school under the tutelage of the catholic church. It was meant for all the children who could neither afford private nor public schools, and they were provided for all the basic amenities needed, as well as a proper schooling from some of the best teachers that could be found. After running for three years and seeing that the number of children only increased, a forum was held as to the best way to tackle this situation and it was agreed that there was need to have a home in which to house all homeless children upon justification that they were either orphans with no one to turn to, or their parents or legal guardians were not in a position to provide for them let alone feed them.
   The program got many sponsors who partnered with the church to help build more buidings and thus expand the place. The first intake was quite successful since the children were seen through the learning process from the primary school to secondary and into the higher level tertiary institutions, while still having good christian values being instilled in them. This led to a second and third, now the place is always occupied, and the number of wellwishers and visitors keeps increasing, all helping to make the children feel loved and part of the community.
